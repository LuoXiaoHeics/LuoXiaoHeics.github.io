I am currently a fifth-year Ph.D. student in Natural language Processing at Zhejiang University -- Westlake University, instructed by Yue Zhang. I obtained my Bachelor's degree from Wuhan University majoring in geographical science in 2020. My current research interests include Retrieval-agumented generation, continual learning, active learning, opinion mining, and graph neural networks.

During my doctoral studies, I had the fortune to collaborate with excellent scientists and researchers, such as Dr. Yingjie Li, Dr. Zihan Liu, Dr. Yafu Li, Dr. Jianhao Yan, Dr Zhen Yang, Professor Xuefeng Bai. If you have any interests in collaborating with me, please drop me an email.

I have two very adorable cats, one of whom is named Heihei, and is also the cat in my profile picture. She's the inspiration behind my nickname. They keep me company while I am coding and writing papers! I hope you can also feel her cuteness :)
